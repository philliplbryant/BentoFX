/**
 * Where a {@link LayoutStorage} implementation that keeps its data on this
 * machine - rather than, say, a remote database - should put it by default.
 *
 * <p>Every storage provider included with this framework is discovered by
 * {@code ServiceLoader}, which requires a public no-arg constructor or a
 * public static {@code provider()} factory: neither can take a caller's
 * configuration as an argument. This class is the alternative - ambient state
 * a provider reads for itself, the same way it already reads {@code user.home} -
 * so an application can still choose where its data goes and, when more than
 * one BentoFX-based application runs on the same machine, give each one a
 * directory of its own rather than have them overwrite each other's layouts
 * under one shared default.</p>
 *
 * <p>Each setting can be given either as a system property or as an
 * environment variable, checked in that order - a system property always wins
 * over an environment variable of the same name. An environment variable
 * needs no application code at all: set it before the process starts and this
 * class picks it up the first time a storage provider asks. Both are read
 * fresh on every call rather than cached, so that setting a property -
 * directly with {@link System#setProperty}, with a {@code -D} JVM flag, or
 * through {@link #configureHome} and {@link #configureNamespace} - takes
 * effect immediately as long as it happens before the first save, restore, or
 * catalog call. Calling either after a storage provider has already been used
 * has no effect on what that provider already opened.</p>
