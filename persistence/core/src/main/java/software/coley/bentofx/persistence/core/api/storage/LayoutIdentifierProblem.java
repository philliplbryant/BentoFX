/**
 * Why a pair of layout identifiers cannot be used, for a caller that wants to ask
 * rather than be refused.
 *
 * <p>{@link LayoutIdentifiers#requireValid} throws for application code that has no
 * business supplying an unusable identifier. A dialog naming a layout is the other
 * case: it needs an answer per keystroke and text to show, so
 * {@link LayoutIdentifiers#findProblem} returns one of these instead. Both come from
 * the same check, so the two can never disagree about what is usable.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@link #rule()} is what to switch on when an application renders its own text,
 * in its own language. {@link #message()} is the framework's rendering, which is also
 * what the throwing entry point reports, and is worth showing when an application has
 * nothing better to say.</p>
 *
 * @param rule which rule the identifiers broke.
 * @param parameter which of the two identifiers broke it.
 * @param message the framework's description of the problem, ready to show.
