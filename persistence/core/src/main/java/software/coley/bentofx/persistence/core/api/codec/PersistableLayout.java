/**
 * What a {@link LayoutCodec} encodes and decodes: the state that makes up a
 * layout, together with the layout-level metadata that travels with it.
 *
 * <p>The state is the {@link BentoState} list a save captured. The one piece of
 * metadata so far is an optional display name, the human-readable label a user
 * gave a layout they saved. It rides inside the encoded layout so that a stored
 * layout carries its own name - a file copied to another machine, or a row read
 * back from a database, arrives knowing what it is called - rather than an
 * application having to keep names in a table of its own.</p>
 *
 * <p>A layout saved without a name, such as the session layout, has no display
 * name. The state list is never {@code null}, though it may be empty.</p>
 *
 * @param displayName the layout's human-readable name, or {@code null} when it
 * has none.
 * @param bentoStates the state that makes up the layout. Copied on
 * construction, so this record does not share a list with its caller.
 * @param group the group the layout belongs to, or {@code null} when it belongs
 * to none.
 * @param groups the groups that exist, which is empty on every layout but the
 * group catalog - see
 * {@link software.coley.bentofx.persistence.core.api.storage.LayoutIdentifiers#GROUP_CATALOG_LAYOUT_IDENTIFIER}.
 * Copied on construction.
