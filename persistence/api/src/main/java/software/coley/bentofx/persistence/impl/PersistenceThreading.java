/**
 * Threading utility methods used by persistence implementations to keep
 * JavaFX object access on the JavaFX application thread while allowing codec
 * and storage work to run off that thread.
 *
 * <p>Off that thread is not the same as asynchronous. Both entry points here are
 * synchronous: they hand work to another thread and wait for it. In particular
 * {@link #callOffFxThread} blocks the JavaFX application thread when that is the
 * caller - see its documentation.</p>
 *
 * <p>Handing work to the JavaFX application thread is not guaranteed to
 * complete. Once the toolkit has shut down, {@link Platform#runLater} accepts a
 * task and silently never runs it, and JavaFX offers no public way to ask
 * whether the toolkit is still alive. Waiting without a bound therefore hangs
 * the calling thread for good. Every wait here is bounded, and a wait that
 * expires cancels the task it was waiting on so a late run cannot apply changes
 * the caller has already given up on.</p>
 *
 * <p>The bounds are deliberately generous. They exist to detect a task that will
 * <em>never</em> run, not to detect one that is merely slow, so they sit orders
 * of magnitude above the real cost of the work.</p>
