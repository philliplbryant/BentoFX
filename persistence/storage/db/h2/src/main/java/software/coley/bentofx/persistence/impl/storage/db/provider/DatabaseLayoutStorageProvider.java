/**
 * Implementation of the {@link LayoutStorageProvider} interface for persisting
 * Bento layouts to H2 databases.
 *
 * <p>Every storage for one database file shares one {@link EntityManagerFactory},
 * created when the first one is requested. A factory starts Hibernate and brings
 * a connection pool with it, while the layouts it serves are one file that a
 * single connection would satisfy; what a saver and a restorer each need of
 * their own is the {@link LayoutStorage}, which is still built per call. The
 * database file is resolved on every call, so changing the home directory
 * moves later storages to a new file (and factory) while storages already
 * handed out keep theirs.</p>
 *
 * <p>Nothing closes the factories before the JVM exits, which is also when
 * the pools and the embedded databases go. There is no earlier moment to close
 * them at: the storages are handed to components that outlive individual saves,
 * and {@link LayoutStorageProvider} has no shutdown of its own to hook into.</p>
 *
 * <p>The database file location is determined by
 * {@link LayoutStorageLocations#HOME_DIRECTORY_PROPERTY} and
 * {@link LayoutStorageLocations#NAMESPACE_PROPERTY}.</p>
